# Restricted Boltzmann Machines from scratch
Example scripts for a type of artificial neural network called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) are written from scratch, revealing how to implement the underlying algorithms without the need for an external library. The model is trained using Contrastive Divergence (CD1). All code is written in Python.

The neural network is trained as a generative model and as a classifier firstly on Rademachers variable and later on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Many of the samples collected from the model look as if they were made by a person. Because the label for each handwritten digit is included during the training process, the neural network can also be used to classify handwritten digits.
